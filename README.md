# Quantum Gate Library
This repository is to collect and define quantum gates that are meaningful to quantum algorithms, domain applications, devices, and operations.

## 1-qubit Gates

### X Gate
X is a Pauli gate which flips the qubit, also known as NOT gate.
```math
$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} X \\\ Y \end{bmatrix}$
```


## 2-qubit Gates


## 3-qubit Gates



## Multi-qubit Gates
